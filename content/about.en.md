## Hello, my name is Óscar

I’m a Multimedia Engineer and multidisciplinary Game Developer. I’ve always been interested in being a solo developer — someone who can take a project from idea to release, covering every aspect of development.
That said, I also enjoy working in teams and collaborating with others.

### Skills

<!-- - **Full Project Management and development**: I'm used to fully planning my own projects, and cover the whole work pipeline. -->
- **Full Project Management and development**: I’m used to planning and building full projects on my own, managing everything from concept to final polish.

<!-- - **2D art**: I've always been the 'art-kid' at school/highschool who was always drawing in class. Even though, as I once said in school to a teacher after a friend told her that I was good at drawing:

> Is not that I'm good drawing, is just that they all draw horrible, so in comparison it seems that I know how to draw.

I totally believe that. {{< text_spoiler "And I also believe that thinking that you '*know*' or fully control something, is always wrong; we are always learning." >}} -->
- **2D art**: I've always been the 'art-kid' at school/highschool who was always drawing in class. I'm interested in many different styles. Maybe being *Pixel Art* one of my '*go to*' styles for games.

- **Programming**:

	- Personally, the biggest challenge when working on a project is preventing the code from becoming an unmanageable monster.
		<!-- - I put special effort on making the code readable, refactoring when is needed. {{< text_spoiler "Which ideally is pretty often." >}}. We spend more time reading than writing code. This becomes even more important when working with a team. -->
		- I put special effort on making the code readable, refactoring when is needed (which is often). We spend more time reading than writing code. This becomes even more important when working with a team.
	<!-- - I don't have a personal preffered language or anything. Even though,  -->
	- I don’t have a personal preferred language. Even though I'm always on the boat of "fast to write" languages.
		<!-- - Deeply focus on refactor and **being sure** that the code I make is good. We spend more time reading code than writing code. -->
	<!-- - C++ leaves the room sad -->
	- Apart from games, I'm also interested in doing other kinds of software, plugins, Blender addons, etc. Or things like this web.

<!-- - **Music Production**: I've been doing music and being interested in music production since 2010.
	- I also do like *synths* and sound production a lot, which is useful for sound effects and such. -->

- **Music Production**: I’ve been producing music since 2010. I also love synths, sound design, and creating audio that fits a game’s atmosphere.


Learning is a big passion of mine.

If I should choose a single thing about myself, is that I care a lot. I know how hard are things to do, the time they take, and I always try to do my best, no matter the subject. I also have a very critic mind and I tend to question myself or what I'm doing, thinking about how it could be better, etc.

<!-- Maybe my best skill is that I have a very critic mind -->

We are here for learning. I personally think that is a positive philosophy, because it means that no matter what is coming to your life, positive 
I think it
each day, when it comes to your mind, your habilities

I'm amazed by today's possibilities

❗❗❗Aquí escribiría sobre mí.

> Hello, my names is Óscar (Suzuka Ka on the internet 🌍)

Mi filosofía de trabajo, mis valores, hobbies, mis motivaciones

"Learning"


Pasarlo bien 
Las cosas que hacemos se impregnan de nuestra actitud.

Poner también cosas como el logo del Grease Pencil Groups

Poner apartado de UI y cosas así:
Creo que es importante que 

Me gusta la psicología

Entrenado para aprender. From my experience, some people tend to refuese

Aprender es como navegar por un oceano en el que al principio está revuelto, te sientes

Sinceramente creo que una de las claves para no abandonar algo es sentirte capaz, que cuando comiences a dominar tanto, el mar se calmará

Hobbies:
Graffiti


No creo que haya una fuerza superior que nos haga venir a la vida a aprender C# o Python (bueno, C++ tal vez)



- In my humble opinion, one of today's biggest challenges when it comes to gamedevelopment (or any media) is to catch the attention. I do think that personality plays a big role

Im not interested in being a clone of a clone


Hablar del tutorial de BBullet, de lo orgulloso que estaba de que estuviera tan integrado.
