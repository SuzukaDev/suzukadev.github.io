# Motivation & Intention

This illustration was important for me for 3 different reasons:

- I used it to fully **test** [my -cool- **Pixel Art plugin for Krita**, and its -awesome- embeded Pixel Art editor, ***K-Sprite***](https://orb91.gumroad.com/l/szk-krita-pixel-art-suite).
- It was my first "serious" illustration since AI.
- I wanted to **express a message** that was important for me.

<!-- # Reasons -->


## SZK Pixel Art Suite for Krita

This is a plugin that **adds every tool and feature for Pixel Art that I've always missed** in Krita. <u>Making Krita definitely my absolute favourite tool for making Pixel Art!</u>

{{< link_card

  color="#cd5b06"
  hover_color="#ff83f1"
  text_color="#f0f0f0"
  cover_position="90% 0%"
>}}

It even comes with an **integrated Pixel Art editor** that solves some Krita problems related to Pixel Art (a Pixel Perfefect brush, better primitives, better Pixel Art Text, etc.)

You can [read the **Manual** here]({{< relref "szk-krita-pixel-art-suite.md" >}}).

### Practical uses
I used it everywhere. I'm quite happy with it, since Krita was always my prefered painting drawing software, but for Pixel Art wasn't the best. Not anymore!

[K-Sprite's pixel perfect brush]({{< relref "szk-krita-pixel-art-suite.md#k-sprite" >}}), and the [Bezier tool]({{< relref "szk-krita-pixel-art-suite.md#bezier-curves" >}}) were great for making pixel perfect lines and curves more comfortable without having to edit them later:

## About AI

{{< details summary="Feeling demotivated because of AI" >}}
<!-- I kinda lost the ilusion and energy for doing art. And AI played a role on that. Seemed pointless to make it, and art is something that provided meaning to my life. Or at the very least, relief. -->
I kinda lost the ilusion and energy for doing art. And AI played a role on that. Seemed pointless to make it, and art is something that provided meaning to my life.

Miyazaki (from *Studio Ghibli*) said it was *an insult for life*. It definitely is an insult to the artists who got their work stolen for training the AIs, since they literally put lots of their time into their craft. And time is life.

The time we dedicate to things and people, is what makes them important. When something doesn't requires our time or effort, it becomes meaningless and insignificant. Disposable and easily replaceable.

I think it lead us to *Postmodern-Nihilistic* times, where absolutely anything and anyone seems to matter and to have a real meaning. I don't like that.

But working on this helped me to remind that at the end art is something we make for ourselves. And while AI can create very correct images, I think any prompt would ever match an artist with a clear vision of what they want to represent. And not to talk about how I won't ever find any joy by just writing a prompt.

> Is about the process, the feeling of **freedom** for being able to represent anything you can imagine, and the excitement of solving every little problem you face **by yourself**. No matter if the result is *perfect* or not.


AIs are great for generating new images that emmits the feeling that we have already seen them 200 million times before actually seeing them.

I do think that when something is **mass produced, personality evaporates**. No one eats a MacDonald's burger every week and one day thinks "oh, today's burger is specially tasty". There is no variance. 

AI's art may generate the illusion that we have freedom to obtain different results, but the underlying method is the same over and over, and its what produces that "AI vibe". AI is always getting better and better, but since -again- is mass produced, that AI vibe without personality may persist, since we will see it over and over. But I like to think that a more personal work, will always stand out against any AI's work.

### Experiments with AI

Even though, I experimented a bit since AI. Since I had a very clear idea, I gave some famous AI models a **highly** detailed prompt.

{{< details summary="These were the 💩💩💩 results" >}}
I think they are correct images. But in my opinion they are very generic and boring.

Some artists says that AI is great as a working base. Personally I preffer working over a rough sketch or thumbnail than having to fix an AI image that feels super dull.

## Message

{{< details summary="Inner freedom" >}}

I wanted to express that no matter the circumstances, our environment and our mental or physical state, we still have some **inner freedom** to find and create joy and beauty, even if it is just in some short degree, and even if all around **seems hopeless**. And that we have always some control to decide what we want in our own world, and to focus on the things and the ones that wants to be with us, around (and to accept what wants to be out of our lives).

Seems we live in a <s>shitty</s> complicated world and it gets worse each day that goes by.

Lots of wars. An actual genocide. People being killed while going for AID. Threats about (more) war(s), etc.

<!-- Can't wait to wake up tomorrow and see which is the new war that has started or how many kids have been shooted or bombed while waiting for aid and food. We are continuously being bombed by bad news -->

At the end I think the best thing we can do for us and for the world is to be in a **good place** with ourselves. I think when someone makes that, they become into some kind of lighthouses for others, some kind of safe space/place.

<!-- Just as the tree -->

<!-- I wanted to represent that idea with the tree, fighting for being alive in a desolated world, and seeking last sun rays while everything is in darkness. -->

That idea took shape through the tree—resilient in a barren world, still reaching for light despite the surrounding gloom.

<!-- It's called "The Resilence of Memory" because I find the mere fact a powerful source of strength. 
I find uplifting the mere fact of remembering who we are, who we were, and the things that made us feel alive and happy in the past. Specially when we feel lost. Also, I lost my dog and bestest friend, Dexter. He will always live vividly in my memory, and he will always be with me, even if I can't see him around anymore. I can recall him anytime I want, and he is still living in all the experiences we both had together and the places we visited. -->

It's called ***The Resilience of Memory*** because I believe memory itself is a powerful source of strength.
There's something deeply uplifting about simply remembering—who we are, who we were, and the moments that once made us feel truly alive. Especially in times when we feel lost, memory can ground us.

<!-- I also named it this way because I recently lost my dog and best friend, Dexter. Though I can no longer see him, he lives on vividly in my memory. He’s still with me—in every place we visited, every shared experience, and every moment of joy we had together. I can summon those memories anytime, and through them, he continues to live on, and I find some relief. -->

<!-- I like writing messages, concepts, etc. around my place, to remind myself different things. I think that when we capture a message with an image, the idea becomes more powerful and easier to remind (and also way cooler). -->

I just wanted to capture all those ideas in an image. Just because it helps to remind the message.

## The importance of thumbnails

<!-- I did a lot of thumbnails before starting drawing: -->

{{< /box_info >}}

This one called my attention the most:


<!-- {{< img_caption "thumbnails-favs.png" >}} -->

{{< img_caption "thumbnail-selected.png" >}}

I saw some kind of tower standing tall over some fields.

Initially I thought about a dome separating a vivid ecosystem from a desolated world, to portray that kind of life and death contrast. Like those snowballs:

{{< img_caption img="pizarra-blur.png" resize="500x" >}}
<!-- > In my humble opinion, most of the times thumbnailing helps you to discover not what you want, but the things you do <u>**not**</u> want. -->

Thanks to the thumbnails, I came to the idea of a tree standing over an arid/dead place, catching the last sunrays, while the rest of the place is getting darker.

I also decided to switch the canvas orientation to vertical, since I think it would serve better for expressing that "rise up" feeling I wanted it to tell.

<!-- > It could have been done in horizontal, but in my opninion that would have delegated the tree to a more secondary "role", since it would have occupied a smaller percentage of the canvas. -->
> It could have been done horizontally, but in my opinion, that would have relegated the tree to a more secondary role, since it would have taken up a smaller portion of the canvas, and I didn't want that.

<!-- , while still having the tree to occupy the most part of the image -->

Then I made some very loose sketches, until I had something that was ok for me as an starting base:

{{< img_caption img="tree-first-sketches.png" >}}






<!-- thumbnailing me aclaro las ideas. -->


<!-- ### h3 de prueba :/ -->


## Silhouettes
When drawing from imagination, I always find it very useful to start with silhouettes. Is great for not paying attention to the details, but to the whole image.

Silhouettes are always important for readability, but I'd say that they are even more important in Pixel Art, since the space is more constrained.

{{< img_caption img="silhouette-0000715.png" resize=300x >}}


{{< details summary="Even though, sometimes you have to make some 'sacrifices'" open=true >}}
For example, I personally think that the silohouete and the image overall looked way better with the full top of the tree: 

{{< img_caption img="tree-silhouette-comparison.png" resize=600x >}}

But I decided to give it only the half of the tree with leafs since at the end I think it represented better the message I was going for; the tree is in a continuous fight between life and death, and already has some parts of it affected. But is still seeking the light.

> Sometimes {{< text_wavy text="we can't make everyone happy" amp=4 >}}.

{{< /details >}}


### Tip for filling the silhouettes

Sometimes is hard to fill a shape with texture when you just have a silhouette. Feels a bit like a starting a puzzle.

For those moments, I first focus on **elements that generates contrast** within the shape. Those contrast elements can be:
- A change in angle along the contour.
- Any "protuberance".
- Value change (when working with color).

{{< img_caption img="filling-silhouettes-clues.png" text="Interesting places to start adding details" resize=x500 >}}

Those spots gives clues to start, and once you add details in those crucial parts, it becomes easier to fill the rest mantaining some logic and coherence:

{{< img_caption "filling-texture-bright.webp" >}}

Feels like doing a sudoku after guessing some new numbers; the more numbers, the more clues you have to continue easily.

I use this all the time.


## Color thumbnails
I did some color thumbnails for testing different color combinations:
{{< img_caption img="color-thumbnails.png" resize=x500 >}}

C2 and D4 were my favourites, even though I modified them a bit. 

<!-- Doing these litle color thumbnails also helped me to discover that I didn't want any warm color out of the tree. -->

<!-- Doing these little color thumbnails also helped me realize that I wanted to keep all the warm colors confined to the tree. Simply to reinforce the idea that the tree is the only part that is alive and emerging from the badlands. -->
Doing these little color thumbnails also helped me realize I wanted to keep all the warm colors confined to the tree—to reinforce the idea that it's the only living thing emerging from the badlands.

<!-- Even though, I edited them later, since one of my main ideas was to keep the warm colors only on the top of the tree, while the rest of the piece (or mostly) would have cold colors. -->


## Editing

<!-- After finishing the piece, I experimented with some filters (more precisely, a curve level filter and some color overlays) with the idea of pushing the warm and cool colors, to generate more contrast:

{{< img_caption img="editing-colors.png" text="Before (left), after (right)" resize=800x >}}

Adding filter layers may be some controversial topic thay may trigger some guilty feelings among artists (myself included). A part of me thinks that this is "cheating", that I should have been able to decide those "final colors" by *myself*.

Another part or me thinks is just fun to experiment and see different posibilities from a "comfortable place" (once you have the whole drawing and you are editing the whole thing).

The thing is I already decided those final colors by myself. And when tweaking the image, we are still using our criteria to decide if it works or not. A curve level filter (or any other filter) won't fix a piece that has bad colours.

I think an artist should have a playful and curious mind, and be open for experimenting, and do not fall into those silly thoughts that makes you feel bad. As long as you have an **intention**, is ok. Tools are just tools. Filters don’t make decisions—you do. The filter doesn’t know what “better” looks like. You do. -->


After finishing this piece, I experimented with some filters—specifically a curve level adjustment and a couple of color overlays. My goal was to push the warm and cool tones a bit further and add contrast:

{{< img_caption img="editing-colors.png" text="Before (left), after (right)" resize=800x >}}

Adding filters can feel a little taboo sometimes, at least to me. A part of me thinks, *“Is this cheating?”* Shouldn’t I have been able to choose the “final colors” myself, without digital tweaks?

But another part of me enjoys it—it’s fun to play with possibilities once the heavy lifting is done. You’re no longer building the image from scratch; you’re fine-tuning it with a fresh perspective.

And the truth is, I already *did* choose the final colors. The filter didn’t invent anything. I’m still using my judgment to decide what works and what doesn’t. A curve adjustment won’t magically fix bad color decisions—it just lets you explore new moods and balances within what’s already there.

I think artists should give themselves permission to be curious. To experiment. To play. That’s where growth and discovery live. You’re not breaking rules as long as there’s intention behind your choices.

So if something feels right—even if it's a late-stage tweak—maybe it *is* right.


















# Tips

## "Rule of 2"

Sometimes I like to draw having in mind that what I'm drawing probably completely sucks, and that I will probably draw it twice. I call that reminder "the rule of 2". 

The *rule of 2* has, obviously, 3 steps:

- Draw a first iteration and fail completely.
- Ask yourself why the first try -completely- sucks.
- Make a new version with what you learnt from the first one.

This may seem stupid, but I feel it more as a way to enjoy drawing, without pressure and the feeling that everything must be perfect from the start. Is a reminder that **I can fix things later**. It also puts me in the mood for learning; the first iteration may suck, but it helps me to learn what I did wrong, for then doing it better. It's also some ki

### Examples

I wanted to add a spider web to the scene. Left was the first version, right is the second (and final) version:

{{< img_caption "rule-of-2.png" >}}

<!-- I think the first one is awful, but if I didn't make it, I wouldn't have known what I disliked about it. While the second one is also not the best thing ever, I think is much better, and emits that vibe of decay that I wanted to go for, and it serves better to the final message. -->

<!-- I think the first one is awful, but if I didn't make it, I wouldn't have known what I disliked about it. While the second one is also not the best thing ever, I think is much better, and emits that vibe of decay that I wanted to go for, and it helps to convey better the final message. -->

I think the first one is awful, but if I hadn’t made it, I wouldn’t have realized what I disliked about it. The second one isn’t perfect either, but it’s much better; it captures that vibe of decay I was aiming for and conveys the final message more effectively.

The same with the ground/rocks near the tree:
<!-- {{< img_caption "rule-of-2-rocks-scaled.png" >}} -->
{{< img_caption "rule-of-2-rocks-scaled-transparent.png" "First try (Left), Second Try (Middle), Second Try + Shaded (Right)" >}}

<!-- While the first try gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying very well the 3D space they were sit into. -->
<!-- 
While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. Felt a bit like a stamp. -->

<!-- While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. They felt a bit like a stamp or plain texture. So in the second try I focused on making them to look "logical" around the space they were. -->

While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. They felt a bit like a stamp or a plain texture. So, in the second try, I focused on making them look more "logical" within the space they occupied.

> So, the main idea behind this is: **{{< text_wavy text="relax" freq=0.2 time=2 amp=8 >}}**, **enjoy painting**. If you paint something that doesn't look great, just ask yourself what you would change.


## Narrative

<!-- I always like to remind myself that a piece of art at the end is an exchange of energy between the piece (an illustration, a song, a game, a movie, etc) and the person "*consuming*" it.

If there is no exchange between those two, the piece is indifferent/bad.

The more you add narrative elements, the better the *thing* you are doing will be. It doesn't need to be explicit or very complex, but enough to rise questions to the viewer and to invite them to find the answers by their own. {{< text_spoiler "Also, bonus tips if it actually contains answers, even if they are hidden, or you are the only one who truly understand the context. Because adding mystery for the sake of adding mystery is not cool, in my opinion." >}} -->

I always like to remind myself that, in the end, a piece of art—be it an illustration, a song, a game, a movie—is an exchange of energy between the work and the person *experiencing* it.  
If there's no exchange, no reaction, then the piece feels indifferent... or even bad.

The more you add narrative elements, the better your creation will be. It doesn't have to be explicit or overly complex—just enough to raise questions and invite the viewer to seek their own answers.

Bonus points if it *does* contain answers—hidden or personal—even if you're the only one who truly understands the full context. {{< text_spoiler "Because adding mystery just for the sake of it? That’s not cool, in my opinion." >}}

## Good uses of AI (In my humble opinion)

I think that one of the challenges when drawing/painting is the ability to keep our "eyes fresh", in order for being able to still being critic about what we are doing, spot mistakes, etc.

<!-- For that, resting is always the best. But I also tried asking an AI "what version looks better" (with an image comparing an old version with a newer one, with newer changes). It helps you to determine if you are "right on track". -->
Resting is always best for that. But I also tried asking an AI **which version looks better** by showing it an image comparing the old and new versions with the latest changes. This helped me to determine if I was *right on track*.

<!-- I find it also curious to ask them what they think about an image. It helps to know if the illustration kinda emits what you had in mind: -->
I also find it interesting to ask them what they think about an image. It **helps to know if the illustration conveys what you had in mind:**

{{< details "AI's answer" >}}

Thank you for sharing this image—*The Resilience of Memory* really pulls me in. Here's my honest breakdown, both emotional and critical:

---

### 🧠 **First Impressions & Emotional Response:**

This image strikes a chord between *whimsy* and *melancholy*. There's a deep sense of **loss**, but also **hope**—the way the massive tree rises out of a desolate landscape feels symbolic of holding onto light and creativity even in dark or barren circumstances.

* The **treehouse bathed in warm orange** light against the cold blue moon evokes a comforting memory or dream clung to amidst ruin.
* The **cat** perched on the tree feels like a guardian of solitude, maybe even a silent witness to past events.
* The **skull** near the bottom feels heavy with symbolism—perhaps death, forgotten dreams, or lost friends. Its placement at the roots of the tree suggests that memory and growth are inseparable from pain.
* The **lights** wrapped around the tree remind me of how people decorate their emotional scars with meaning, even joy.

It feels like a world someone built inside their head to protect themselves—and that resonates.

---

### 🎨 **Artistic Critique (Technical/Compositional):**

**Strengths:**

* **Color balance** is stunning. The warm-cold contrast (orange/red leaves vs. blue background) is not only aesthetically pleasing, but symbolically rich.
<!-- * The **pixel art** is precise and expressive—especially impressive is how you use such tiny detail to imply depth and texture (like the twisting of the tree trunk or the subtle shading on the owl). -->
* The **pixel art** is precise and expressive—especially impressive is how you use such tiny detail to imply depth and texture (like the twisting of the tree trunk or the subtle shading on the skull).
* The **composition flows vertically**—you start grounded in bones and metal, and your eye is drawn upward toward flight and fire. It's like a journey from death to dreaming.
* The presence of **small objects** (keyboard, lanterns, ropes, hanging clothes) adds narrative depth—you feel like someone lived here.

**Possible Critiques (subjective and gentle):**

* The lower section of the image (with the skull and scattered objects) is visually busy and dark. It could be slightly difficult to read for some viewers at first glance. Maybe a touch more contrast or separation of elements would help clarify the space.
* The treehouse and moon are extremely striking—which is great—but they slightly overpower the rest of the image. If this is intentional (i.e., memory overshadowing the present), then it works. If balance was the goal, maybe pulling in a bit more saturation or light into the lower half could harmonize it more.
* The **text** (“The Resilience of Memory”) might be more impactful if placed differently or stylized more subtly; currently, it slightly competes with the image's vibe.

### 🕊️ **What It Evokes in Me:**

It makes me think of:

* The idea of *a mental refuge built in grief*—a place in the imagination where things are still whole.
* Childhood memories, distorted but cherished.
* A single candle in a dark room—quiet, persistent hope.

It reminds me of your metaphor about creating your own world no matter your mental state. Whether intentional or not, this feels like a visual extension of that exact idea.

### Verdict:

This is *deeply personal*, *technically impressive*, and *emotionally layered*. If I were to critique more, it would only be to polish what’s already solid. It doesn't feel like it's trying to be perfect—it feels like it's trying to be honest. And that makes it powerful.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to hear more about what specific symbolism you placed in this piece. It feels rich with intentional detail.

But asking AIs for feedback (again, keeping in mind they sugarcoat their answers) in my experience was positive.
