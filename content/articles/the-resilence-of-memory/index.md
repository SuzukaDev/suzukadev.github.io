# Motivation & Intention

This illustration was important for me for 3 different reasons:

- I used it to fully test [my -cool- **Pixel Art plugin for Krita**, and its -awesome- embeded Pixel Art editor, ***K-Sprite***](https://orb91.gumroad.com/l/szk-krita-pixel-art-suite).
- It was my first "serious" illustration since AI.
- I wanted to express a message that was important for me.

<!-- # Reasons -->


## SZK Pixel Art Suite for Krita

This is a plugin that adds every tool and feature for Pixel Art that I've always missed in Krita. Making Krita definitely my absolute favourite tool for making Pixel Art.

  hover_color="#ff83f1"
  text_color="#f0f0f0"

It even comes with an integrated Pixel Art editor that solves some Krita problems related to Pixel Art (a Pixel Perfefect brush, better primitives, better Pixel Art Text, etc.)

## About AI

{{< details summary="Feeling demotivated because of AI" >}}
<!-- I kinda lost the ilusion and energy for doing art. And AI played a role on that. Seemed pointless to make it, and art is something that provided meaning to my life. Or at the very least, relief. -->
I kinda lost the ilusion and energy for doing art. And AI played a role on that. Seemed pointless to make it, and art is something that provided meaning to my life.

Miyazaki (from *Studio Ghibli*) said it was *an insult for life*. It definitely is an insult to the artists who got their work stolen for training the AIs, since they literally put lots of their time into their craft. And time is life.

The time we dedicate to things and people, is what makes them important. When something doesn't requires our time or effort, it becomes meaningless and insignificant. Disposable and easily replaceable.

I think it lead us to *Postmodern-Nihilistic* times, where absolutely anything and anyone seems to matter and to have a real meaning. I don't like that.

But working on this helped me to remind that at the end art is something we make for ourselves. And while AI can create very correct images, I think any prompt would ever match an artist with a clear vision of what they want to represent. And not to talk about how I won't ever find any joy by just writing a prompt.

> Is about the process, the feeling of **freedom** for being able to represent anything you can imagine, and the excitement of solving every little problem you face **by yourself**. No matter if the result is *perfect* or not.


AIs are great for generating new images that emmits the feeling that we have already seen them 200 million times before actually seeing them.

I do think that when something is **mass produced, personality evaporates**. No one eats a MacDonald's burger every week and one day thinks "oh, today's burger is specially tasty". There is no variance. 

AI's art may generate the illusion that we have freedom to obtain different results, but the underlying method is the same over and over, and its what produces that "AI vibe". AI is always getting better and better, but since -again- is mass produced, that AI vibe without personality may persist, since we will see it over and over. But I like to think that a more personal work, will always stand out against any AI's work.

### Experiments with AI

Even though, I experimented a bit since AI. Since I had a very clear idea, I gave some famous AI models a **highly** detailed prompt.

{{< details summary="These were the results" >}}
I think they are correct images. But in my opinion they are very generic and boring.

Some artists says that AI is great as a working base. Personally I preffer working over a rough sketch or thumbnail than having to fix an AI image that feels super dull.

## Message

{{< details summary="Inner freedom" >}}

I wanted to express that no matter the circumstances, our environment and our mental or physical state, we still have some **inner freedom** to find and create joy and beauty, even if it is just in some short degree, and even if all around **seems** hopeless. And that we have always some control to decide what we want in our own world, and to focus on the things and the ones that wants to be with us, around (and to accept what wants to be out of our lives).

Seems we live in a <s>shitty</s> complicated world and it gets worse each day that goes by.

Lots of wars. An actual genocide. People being killed while going for AID. Threats about (more) war(s), etc.

<!-- Can't wait to wake up tomorrow and see which is the new war that has started or how many kids have been shooted or bombed while waiting for aid and food. We are continuously being bombed by bad news -->

At the end I think the best thing we can do for us and for the world is to be in a **good place** with ourselves. I think when someone makes that, they become into some kind of lighthouses for others, some kind of safe space/place.

<!-- Just as the tree -->

I wanted to represent that idea with the tree, fighting for being alive in a desolated world, and seeking last sun rays while everything is in darkness.



I like writing messages, concepts, etc. around my place, to remind myself different things. I think that when we capture a message with an image, the idea becomes more powerful and easier to remind (and also way cooler).

<!-- I do believe images are powerful. I do love writing litle messages for myself, and having them around. And I personally think that when a message is tied to an image, it becomes easier to remind (and also way cooler). -->

# Process

## The importance of thumbnails

I did a lot of thumbnails before starting drawing:

{{< img_caption "thumbnails-favs.png" >}}

<!-- And I fell in love with "thumbnailing" (is that a word), since is a powerful tool to help you discover not only what works, or what you want, but also what doesn't work, and helps you to discard or to find new ideas: -->
Making thumbnails is a powerful tool to help you discover not only what works, or what you want, but also what doesn't work, and helps you to discard or to find new ideas.

{{< box_info >}}

PS: I made a [cool plugin for *Krita* for making thumbnails (***SZK Thumbnailer***)](https://orb91.gumroad.com/l/szk-krita-thumbnailer)

<!-- Most of the times, thumbnailing helps you to  -->

{{< link_card title="SZK Thumbnailer (Krita)"

c="rgb(52, 53, 58)"

position="50% 50%" >}}

{{< /box_info >}}

This one called my attention the most:


<!-- {{< img_caption "thumbnails-favs.png" >}} -->

{{< img_caption "thumbnail-selected.png" >}}

I saw some kind of tower standing tall over some fields.

Initially I thought about a dome separating a vivid ecosystem from a desolated world, to portray that kind of life and death contrast. Like those snowballs:

{{< img_caption img="pizarra-blur.png" resize="500x" >}}
<!-- > In my humble opinion, most of the times thumbnailing helps you to discover not what you want, but the things you do <u>**not**</u> want. -->

Thanks to the thumbnails, I came to the idea of a tree standing over an arid/dead place, catching the last sunrays, while the rest of the place is getting darker.

I also decided to switch the canvas orientation to vertical, since I think it would serve better for expressing that "rise up" feeling I wanted it to tell.

<!-- > It could have been done in horizontal, but in my opninion that would have delegated the tree to a more secondary "role", since it would have occupied a smaller percentage of the canvas. -->
> It could have been done horizontally, but in my opinion, that would have relegated the tree to a more secondary role, since it would have taken up a smaller portion of the canvas, and I didn't want that.

<!-- , while still having the tree to occupy the most part of the image -->

Then I made some very loose sketches, until I had something that was ok for me as an starting base:

{{< img_caption img="tree-first-sketches.png" >}}



<!-- thumbnailing me aclaro las ideas. -->


<!-- ### h3 de prueba :/ -->


# Silhouettes
When drawing from imagination, I always find it very useful to start with silhouettes. Is great for not paying attention to the details, but to the whole image.

Silhouettes are always important for readability, but I'd say that they are even more important in Pixel Art, since the space is more constrained.

{{< img_caption img="silhouette-0000715.png" resize=300x >}}


{{< details summary="Even though, sometimes you have to make some 'sacrifices'" open=true >}}
For example, I personally think that the silohouete and the image overall looked way better with the full top of the tree: 

{{< img_caption img="tree-silhouette-comparison.png" resize=600x >}}

But I decided to give it only the half of the tree with leafs since at the end I think it represented better the message I was going for; the tree is in a continuous fight between life and death, and already has some parts of it affected. But is still seeking the light.

# Rule of 2

Sometimes I like to draw having in mind that what I'm drawing probably completely sucks, and that I will probably draw it twice. I call that reminder "the rule of 2". It has these simple steps:

- Draw a first iteration and fail completely.
- Ask yourself why the first try -completely- sucks.
- Make a new version with what you learnt from the first one.

This may seem stupid, but I feel it more as a way to enjoy drawing, without pressure and the feeling that everything must be perfect from the start. Is a reminder that **I can fix things later**. It also puts me in the mood for learning; the first iteration may suck, but it helps me to learn what I did wrong, for then doing it better.

## Examples

I wanted to add a spider web to the scene. Left was the first version, right is the second (and final) version:

{{< img_caption "rule-of-2.png" >}}

<!-- I think the first one is awful, but if I didn't make it, I wouldn't have known what I disliked about it. While the second one is also not the best thing ever, I think is much better, and emits that vibe of decay that I wanted to go for, and it serves better to the final message. -->

<!-- I think the first one is awful, but if I didn't make it, I wouldn't have known what I disliked about it. While the second one is also not the best thing ever, I think is much better, and emits that vibe of decay that I wanted to go for, and it helps to convey better the final message. -->

I think the first one is awful, but if I hadn’t made it, I wouldn’t have realized what I disliked about it. The second one isn’t perfect either, but it’s much better; it captures that vibe of decay I was aiming for and conveys the final message more effectively.

The same with the ground/rocks near the tree:
<!-- {{< img_caption "rule-of-2-rocks-scaled.png" >}} -->
{{< img_caption "rule-of-2-rocks-scaled-transparent.png" "First try (Left), Second Try (Middle), Second Try + Shaded (Right)" >}}

<!-- While the first try gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying very well the 3D space they were sit into. -->
<!-- 
While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. Felt a bit like a stamp. -->

<!-- While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. They felt a bit like a stamp or plain texture. So in the second try I focused on making them to look "logical" around the space they were. -->

While the first attempt gave me the "rocky" feeling I was going for, I felt the rocks were not conveying the 3D space they were situated in very well. They felt a bit like a stamp or a plain texture. So, in the second try, I focused on making them look more "logical" within the space they occupied.

> So, the main idea behind this is: **{{< text_wavy text="relax" freq=0.2 time=2 amp=8 >}}**, **enjoy painting**. If you paint something that doesn't look great, just ask yourself what you would change.
