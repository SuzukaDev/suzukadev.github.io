# About me

Hello, my name is **Óscar** (also known as Suzuka/Suzuka Ka on the internet), and I personally find very hard to describe myself (or anyone else) with just a few words, but I'll try ({{< text_spoiler "and if I 'fail' in using not so many words, since this is *my place* I feel free to *ramble on (and sing my song)*" >}}):

I'm technically a **multimedia engineer/game developer**. I'm very passionate about making games. There is no need to express how/why videogames are kinda the *pinnacle* of art of our times. There is no other art medium that could compare to the unique experiences that videogames can offer. And also, there is no other medium as complex and conformed by many disciplines as game development is.

My **skills** are **wide**, I'm multidisciplinary. From programming to art (you can [check **some of my work** here]({{< ref "galleries/my-work" >}}) ). I strongly believe that the more knowledge we have, the more *periferic view* we have over a problem and the more tools we have to solve it in many different ways. 

I like to understand things as an interconnected-whole. I personally often visualize concepts as some kind of root branches or skill tree; there are some root nodes from which derives others and they all have common keypoints. Nothing is fully disconnected and we can extrapolate knowledge from one topic/skill to another.

<!-- For example, I think that knowing to draw (or better said, why do some images works while others don't) makes you a better UI dessigner. -->

<!-- For example, I think that understanding why images (illustration) -->





The thing I may be more passionate about is... just **creating**. No matter the subject (a game, an app, an illustration, a song...). When it comes to a project, I do feel motivated by the idea of simply solving or doing something that I personally missed or want. Or for doing something that is helpful or makes something easier.
I do enjoy the challenge of imagining different solutions, ways to tackle the problem. The feeling of being lost at the start, thinking about all the different approaches and possibilities when you start from nothing. The *detectivesque* feeling of solving every puzzle/problem you encounter during the development, and the *{{< text_shimmer "eureka 😎" >}}* moments right after the "{{< text_handwritten text="why this doesn't work?" frame_time=0.2 fx=1.0 time_variation=0.1 >}} {{< text_handwritten text="I hate my life 😡" frame_time=0.1 fx=5.0 time_variation=0.1 scale=0.05 >}}" breakdowns.


With the time, I've discovered a lot of joy by making tools, software/apps, plugins for different programs, etc. I find very inspirational to help other people to make cool things, even if its just a bit, with some app/software/plugin I did. Is something that fulfills me.

There is also something cool about creating your own tools, to have the power to shape them to your needs and being able to add whatever you want, need or find cool. 


<!-- Even though, the drawback of that is that you spend less time doing art because you are working in the tool -->

<!-- Some personal highlights of mine are that animators that worked in shows like Rick & Morty, The Cuphead Show, and Bob's Burger, and games like Hi-fi Rush, among others, got some of my tools. -->

A personal highlight for me is that some of my tools have been picked up by animators who’ve worked on shows like *Rick & Morty*, *The Cuphead Show*, *Bob’s Burgers*, and games like *Hi-Fi Rush*. [You can check **some of them here**]({{< relref "articles/manuals" >}}).

# My Life & Work Philosophy

<!-- **As a person**, I find meaning in learning. I personally think life is about that. My life philosophy could be summed up with that. -->

**As a person**, I find meaning in learning. I personally believe life is about learning. My life philosophy could be summed up with that.

<!-- I think it enables you to extract positive things even from negative experiences,  -->

<!-- Lear -->

<!-- I do resonate with this quote: -->
Leaving aside personal aspects of that philosophy, when it comes to work, I do resonate a lot with this quote:

{{< quote "Once you know what it is in life that you want to do, then the world basically becomes your library. Everything you view, you can view from that perspective, which makes everything a learning asset for you." "Kobe Bryant" >}}

<!-- By learning learn about the world -->


{{< img_caption "pacific-road-thankyou.gif" >}}

<!-- There was a thunderstorm when I was working in this game jam. I remember observing it, taking notes, using my phone to measure the times of the flash, the sound, the frequency, etc., every time I saw a thunder, for later reproducing it in my little game.

This is just a silly example, but kinda illustrates the symbiotic relationship between work and life. The world bleeds into what we make, and what we make teaches us to see the world more closely, and to keep curiosity alive. -->

I add this image because there was a thunderstorm while I was working on this game jam. I remember observing it —taking notes, using my phone to measure the timing of the flash, the sound, the frequency— every time lightning struck, so I could later reproduce it in my little game.

It’s a small, maybe even silly example, but it captures the symbiotic relationship between work and life. The world bleeds into what we make, and what we make teaches us to see the world more closely—and to keep our curiosity alive.

That back-and-forth is what keeps making things feel meaningful.



<!-- I just have patience -->

When learning, I am motivated by the new possibilities that learning a new skill/knowledge offers. Every time we learn new things, is like discovering new routes and tools for helping us to approach any problem in different ways.

I've been told that I learn fast. To be honest, I don't know if that's true, but I know I'm a very curious and stubborn person.



<!-- I've been told that I'm creative

I think I've always kinda had an engineer mind

I'm not sure


I specially like learning new habilities, and things that expands my vision


I do 


Luck is sadly also an important factor


The more skillsets you have, the more ways you have to solve problems. -->


<!-- ## Voy por aqui -->


My second pivot point about my life philosophy, is that kindness is important. I have death very present in my life. We all have an expiration date yet to discover, and that date may be sooner than we would expect/wish.

If that happens, I think only a few aspects of ouselves will "survive":

- How we have treated others, any positive impact we produced in someone else.

- Our work.

When working with others, I'm very flexible and I rarely have a bossy/demanding attitude. Even though, I have no problem 'standing up' if I know at 100% that something will lead to a fail or should be changed. But overall, I think a good and kind work ambience is always important.

I also respect deeply others' work. Even though, I can also be very critic if the other person is willing or allows me to be, since at the end a good critizise offers the possibility to grow.


I personally do not feel the urge to change other's views (and to be honest this feels like a super power nowadays). I'm always curious to learn about other views that are different than mine, even if is just to reinforce mines. But overall, my peace is rarely altered by others. 
Even though, I think there are some common grounds we all should share and defend firmly, specially when it comes to basic human rights and decency. Basic things as do **not** discriminating someone because of their sex, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, how they identify themselves, etc., is a must, in my humble opinion.
I think empathy and understanding is key.

<!-- I also have no problem 'standing up' if I know at 100% that something will lead -->

<!-- - -->

<!-- I believe our work reflects who we are. I believe the care and detail we put in our craft is noticeable, and speaks about who we are. -->
<!-- I think at the end is a way of self respect. If something is worth doing, is worthy for doing it right. -->

<!-- I believe our work reflects who we are. The care and attention to detail we put into our craft is noticeable — it speaks volumes about us. In the end, it's a form of self-respect with ourselves and our time: if something is worth doing, it's worth doing right. -->

About **our work**, I believe it **reflects who we are**. The care and attention to detail we put into our craft is noticeable — it speaks volumes about us. In the end, it's a form of self-respect. For ourselves and for our time. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right.

One of the things I personally value the most, is personality. Not trying to be a copycat, a clone of a clone. I think is hard to create something unique, since well, feels like everything is already invented. But I think is easy to make something with personality.




<!-- - Some milestones of my work (rick morty ) -->


As a person... I think I tend to be insecure (always (absolutely always) questioning myself, the things I do, asking myself how to do it better, etc). I think this leads sometimes into that kind of analysis-paralysis. I might revisit this text a few times in case it sounds silly for me. I can also be sometimes a scatterbrain, when I'm thinking about a problem or anything.

I think I'm adding this because I personally dislike when in a portfolio someone is trying to fake or prettend to be a much better version of themselves.


If you have got until here, thank you, **I appreciate it**.
