# Grease Pencil Groups++ üìÇ | Suzuka Ka

![=anim_webp_12-10-2023_21-19-16,85.webp](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/anim_webp_12-10-2023_21-19-1685.webp)

This Blender add-on **`adds groups functionality` (and more things‚ùó üéâ**) to **Blender‚Äôs Grease Pencil!**
It‚Äôs meant to make working with the Grease Pencil a more pleasant (and organized!) experience and to perform redundant tasks more quickly.
Moreover, it also provides some new little features that make drawing with Grease Pencil more alike to drawing with other graphic softwares.

> I made (and **I‚Äôm making!**) this addon for my daily use to simplify my life a bit, and I‚Äôm continously adding every improvement and idea I can think of, so its ensured to have the maximum quality possible!
If you have an idea or something that you think will be cool to be implemented, I‚Äôm open to listen!
> 

# Installation üíª

1. Download the .zip file with the addon and place it wherever you like.
2. In Blender, go to `Edit ‚Üí Preferences`. Once there, press the `Add-ons` tab and press `Install` button on the top-right corner:

![Untitled](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/Untitled.png)

1. Select the .zip file.
2. Once installed, search for ‚ÄúGrease Pencil Groups‚Äù in the search bar, and enable the addon.

# Setup üõ†

The add-on pannel will appear in the `Properties panel`, along with the original layer panel.

To start using it, simply click the Initialize button to add the current layers in the active Grease Pencil:

![setup 4.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/setup_4.gif)

<aside>
üí° Note: adding a layer outside the Layers & Group panel will make the group system to be outdated.
If so, don‚Äôt worry, a button will appear to refresh changes.

> I personally suggest that if you preffer to use the add-on panel instead of the old layer panel, just drag it on top (or whereever you like), so you don‚Äôt miss it:
> 

![drag 3.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/drag_3.gif)

> üì¢ I could have overriden Blender‚Äôs default layer panel, but I personally don‚Äôt like to get rid of original UI elements, in case some users would like to still use the native layer panel.
> 
</aside>

# Interface üñ•Ô∏è

<aside>
üí° TIP: Every button is documented and lots of operators have different options when they are pressed with `CTRL`/`ALT`/`SHIFT`. Everything is explained in their tooltip. `Check the tooltip (by hoovering the mouse cursor) to discover new shortcuts and functionality`.

</aside>

![=anim_webp_10-10-2023_19-13-04,39.webp](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/anim_webp_10-10-2023_19-13-0439.webp)

# Manual ‚öô

## Adding Layers/Groups `+`

Use the `New Layer` and `New Groups` buttons to add new elements.

1. **Add Layer ‚úè:** 
    1. Hold `SHIFT` to add the new layer **above** the selected element
    2. Hold`CTRL` when a closed group is selected, to add the new layer into it.
    3. Hold `ALT` to add the new layer **below** the selected group/layer
2. **Add Group üìÇ:**
    1. Hold `SHIFT` to place the selected element into the new group.
    2. Hold `CONTROL` while having selected a group to place the new group inside the selected.
    3. Hold `ALT` to add a group **below** the selected item.
    4. Hold `SHIFT` and `CONTROL` to add a new group and put all the elements that are below it inside.

### Deleting a Layer/Group ‚ùå

Click the trash icon `üóë` next to the `New Group` button to delete an element.

If the selected element is a group, it will only delete the group, but leaves all their children.

You can delete the group and all its content by pressing the delete button while holding `CONTROL`.

![delete.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/delete.gif)

<aside>
üí° Tip: Press `SHIFT + Click` to clean a Group üßπ:

![clean group v2.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/clean_group_v2.gif)

This will delete all hidden layers inside a group.

</aside>

## Editing layers and groups

Changing a property in a layer will affect only to that layer. Modifying a property in a group, will affect to all its layers and groups contained.

![Hiding the group will hide all its elements. Also, adding a mask to a group will add that mask to all its children. If you edit masks in a group, all their children will be edited.](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/Masks.gif)

Hiding the group will hide all its elements. Also, adding a mask to a group will add that mask to all its children. If you edit masks in a group, all their children will be edited.

## Moving elements ‚§¥

You can easily move the elements using the arrow buttons:

![move arrows 1.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/move_arrows_1.gif)

If you need to move an element ‚Äúfarther‚Äù and don‚Äôt want to move it step by step, you can use the `Move To` panel:

![move panel.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/move_panel.gif)

There, simply click an element to put the selected element inside/above/below it (by holding `SHIFT`/`CONTROL` (see the panel for more information)).

<aside>
üí° You can trigger the Move panel in the 3D View by pressing `M` while being in Paint Mode

</aside>

<aside>
üí° Tip: If you want to move the elements faster and directly from the list view and bypass the move menu, you can press the üëÅ button next to the `Move To` panel to show/hide the move buttons/operators:

![=anim_webp_12-10-2023_13-17-45,13.webp](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/anim_webp_12-10-2023_13-17-4513.webp)

By clicking the dots on the left, you will move the active layer/group like in the `Move To` panel. Also, the same hotkeys apply here (see the tooltip for more info):

![move panel uilist.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/move_panel_uilist.gif)

</aside>

## Merging Groups & Layers ‚¨á

You can merge layers as usual, but also combine the entire content of a group.

![merge normal.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/merge_normal.gif)

You can also copy a group into a single layer:

![copy group to layer.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/copy_group_to_layer.gif)

You can find the merge operator (and others) in the drop down menu accesed by this button in the top bar:

![Untitled](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/Untitled%201.png)

<aside>
üí° Tip: You can decide what operators to show in the layer/group and top bar with [‚Äúfavourite operators‚Äù in preferences](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774.md)

</aside>

The addon comes with an **improved way to merge layers** when their opacity is lower than 1.0*

> *Blender don‚Äôt merge correctly the layers when they have transparency.
> 
> 
> ![With Blender‚Äôs normal merge behaviour (the transparency changes)](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/mergebad.webp)
> 
> With Blender‚Äôs normal merge behaviour (the transparency changes)
> 
> üí™With the improved way to merge:
> 
> ![The result more faithful to the original state (without merging layers).](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/mergegoodV2.webp)
> 
> The result more faithful to the original state (without merging layers).
> 

To activate this mode, press `SHIFT + RightClick` when executing the operator.

This will manually sets the (being slower to merge, but offering better results)

## Customize Colors üé®

Press `SHIFT + ALT + Left Click` to ungroup the last element in the group

</aside>

## Solo Modes üîç

Blender‚Äôs solo mode has been improved*‚ùó

> Originally, after exiting the solo mode all layers became visible (no matter if they were originally hidden).
> 

With this addon, you don‚Äôt loose any change on your drawing since it saves it previous state.

You can solo the layers/groups visibility üëÅ and lock üîê state.

<aside>
üí° The lock solo mode is specially -super- useful (‚ùó) when sculpting, editing the strokes, weight painting, moving frames in the dopesheet, etc.
(I use it a lot!)

</aside>

You can find them in the menu (next to the move arrows). Or you can add a shortcut to it ([see Favourite Operators in Preferences](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774.md)).

Both solo modes `offers different **filter levels**`:

1. **Selected** - Only the selected element will be visible. If the selected element is a group, all its descendants will be visible.
2. **Siblings** - Only the selected element and its siblings will be visible.
3. **Top folder** - All elements in the root folder (in case of existing) will be visible.

![solo ez 3mb.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/solo_ez_3mb.gif)

It offers 2 possibilities for the visibility solo mode: `Hide layers` & `Opacity fade`. [Read about them here](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774.md).

## Inherited alpha üñå

Click the alpha button next to the layer/groups properties to activate it.

When Inherited alpha is enabled, the layer/group content will only be visible in their sibling‚Äôs opacity.

![inherit alpha 1.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/inherit_alpha_1.gif)

In this example, the base color and the shadow were drawn without considering whether they went outside the contour of the ball or not. When activating the alpha, its content is clipped by their siblings‚Äô opactity, fitting perfectly into the ball‚Äôs silhouette.

This was a feature that prettends to imitate [Krita‚Äôs inherited alpha](https://docs.krita.org/en/tutorials/clipping_masks_and_alpha_inheritance.html).

# Preferences üõ†

### Settings ‚öô

- `Use lighs by default` - If True, (unparented*) new layers and groups will use lights when they are created. *If they are created inside a group, they will inherit the group‚Äôs current properties.
- `Keep Vertex colors when changing brushes` - By default, each brush has its own main and secondary colour, so you lost the colour you had selected when changing to a new brush. Useful when you want to use another brush for its texture but you want to continue painting with the colour you had selected.
- `Solo visibility mode` - Select the method used when soloing the layers‚Äô visibility. Offers 2 options:
    1. **Hide layers**: only the layers filtered will be visible, while the others will be completely hidden.
        
        ![solo hide.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/solo_hide.gif)
        
    2. **Opactiy fade**: the layers filtered will be visible with its original opacity, while the rest will be faded by the selected opacity percentage in prefferences.
        
        ![solo opacity skull.gif](Grease%20Pencil%20Groups++%20%F0%9F%93%82%20Suzuka%20Ka%2030d03fc01dd34a0ca03284d6273aa774/solo_opacity_skull.gif)
        
- `Duplicate Prefixes/Suffixes` - Set the prefixes (left) and suffixes (right) added when duplicating a group and a layer.
- `Automatic check for new versions` - If True (recommended), the addon will automatically check if there is a newer version uploaded.

# FAQ‚ùî

- Why do you write a FAQ section if no one has asked you a single question related the add-on?
    
    Thats a very good question. I don‚Äôt know. I guess that if I ever got asked about something ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù (more than 0 times), I‚Äôll clarify it here in case it‚Äôs useful for others üê¢.
    
- Why did you put icons on the header?
    
    I personally like when I can distinguish clearly when some functionality comes from an addon I have installed and is not something native from Blender. Also, since I decided not to override the original Layer panel (in case someone would like to continue using it while having this addon installed), I wanted to make the panel to stand out from the other one. 
    
    - Also, I like to show my dog, Dex
