It’s meant to make working with the Grease Pencil a more pleasant (and organized!) experience and to perform redundant tasks more quickly.
Moreover, it also provides some new little features that make drawing with Grease Pencil more alike to drawing with other graphic softwares.

> I made (and **I’m making!**) this addon for my daily use to simplify my life a bit, and I’m continously adding every improvement and idea I can think of, so its ensured to have the maximum quality possible!
If you have an idea or something that you think will be cool to be implemented, I’m open to listen!

{{< /box_info >}}

## Installation 💻

1. Download the .zip file with the addon and place it wherever you like.
2. In Blender, go to `Edit → Preferences`. Once there, press the `Add-ons` tab and press `Install` button on the top-right corner:

![Untitled](images/installation.png)

3. Select the .zip file.
4. Once installed, search for “Grease Pencil Groups” in the search bar, and enable the addon.

## Setup 🛠

The add-on pannel will appear in the `Properties panel`, along with the original layer panel.

To start using it, simply click the Initialize button to add the current layers in the active Grease Pencil:

![setup 4.gif](/images/setup_4.gif)

{{< box_info >}}
💡 Note: adding a layer **outside** the Layers & Group panel will make the group system to be **outdated**.
If so, don’t worry, a button will appear to refresh changes.

> I personally suggest that if you preffer to use the add-on panel instead of the old layer panel, just drag it on top (or whereever you like), so you don’t miss it:
![drag 3.gif](images/drag_3.gif)


{{< box_info "📢" >}}

I could have overriden Blender’s default layer panel, but I personally don’t like to get rid of original UI elements, in case some users would like to still use the native layer panel.

{{< /box_info >}}

{{< /box_info >}}

## Interface 🖥️

{{< box_green "💡" >}}
**TIP**: Every button is documented and lots of operators have different options when they are pressed with {{< shortcut "CTRL" >}}/{{< shortcut "ALT" >}}/{{< shortcut "SHIFT" >}}. Everything is explained in their tooltip. **Check the tooltip** (by hoovering the mouse cursor) **to discover new shortcuts and functionality**.
{{< /box_green >}}


![=anim_webp_10-10-2023_19-13-04,39.webp](/images/anim_webp_10-10-2023_19-13-0439.webp)

## Manual ⚙

### Adding Layers/Groups `+`

Use the {{< shortcut "New Layer" >}} and {{< shortcut "New Groups" >}} buttons to add new elements.

1. **Add Layer ✏:** 
    1. Hold {{< shortcut "SHIFT" >}} to add the new layer **above** the selected element
    2. Hold {{< shortcut "CTRL" >}} when a **closed group** is **selected**, to add the new layer into it.
    3. Hold {{< shortcut "ALT" >}} to add the new layer **below** the selected group/layer
2. **Add Group 📂:**
    1. Hold {{< shortcut "SHIFT" >}} to place the **selected element** into the **new group**.
    2. Hold {{< shortcut "CONTROL" >}} while having selected a group to **place the new group inside the selected**.
    3. Hold {{< shortcut "ALT" >}} to add a group **below** the selected item.
    4. Hold {{< shortcut "SHIFT+CONTROL" >}} to add a new group and **put all the elements that are below it inside**.

#### Deleting a Layer/Group ❌

Click the **trash icon** {{< shortcut "🗑️" >}} next to the {{< shortcut "New Group" >}} button to **delete an element**.
{{< box_info >}}
If the selected element is a group, it will only delete the group, but leaves all their children.
{{< /box_info >}}

{{< box_green "💡" >}}

You can **delete** the **group and all its content** by pressing the delete button while holding {{< shortcut "CONTROL" >}}.

![delete.gif](images/delete.gif)
{{< /box_green >}}


{{< box_green "💡" >}}

**Tip**: Press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + Click" >}} to clean a Group 🧹:

![clean group v2.gif](images/clean_group_v2.gif)

This will **delete all hidden layers** inside a group.

{{< /box_green >}}


### Editing layers and groups

Changing a property in a layer will affect only to that layer. **Modifying a property in a group, will affect to all its layers and groups contained**.

![Hiding the group will hide all its elements. Also, adding a mask to a group will add that mask to all its children. If you edit masks in a group, all their children will be edited.](/images/Masks.gif)

Hiding the group will hide all its elements. Also, adding a mask to a group will add that mask to all its children. If you edit masks in a group, all their children will be edited.

### Moving elements ⤴

You can easily move the elements using the arrow buttons:

![move arrows 1.gif](/images/move_arrows_1.gif)

If you need to move an element “farther” and don’t want to move it step by step, you can use the `Move To` panel:

![move panel.gif](/images/move_panel.gif)

There, simply click an element to put the selected element inside/above/below it (by holding `SHIFT`/`CONTROL` (see the panel for more information)).

{{< box_info "💡" >}}

You can trigger the Move panel in the 3D View by pressing {{< shortcut "M" >}} while being in Paint Mode

{{< /box_info >}}


{{< box_green "💡" >}}

**Tip**: If you want to move the elements faster and directly from the list view and bypass the move menu, you can press the 👁️️ button next to the `Move To` panel to show/hide the move buttons/operators:

![=anim_webp_12-10-2023_13-17-45,13.webp](images/anim_webp_12-10-2023_13-17-4513.webp)

By clicking the **dots** on the left, you will move the active layer/group like in the `Move To` panel. 

Also, **the same moving hotkeys apply here** (see the tooltip for more info):

![move panel uilist.gif](images/move_panel_uilist.gif)

{{< /box_green >}}

### Merging Groups & Layers ⬇

**You can** merge layers as usual, but also **combine the entire content of a group**.

![merge normal.gif](/images/merge_normal.gif)

You can also **copy a group into a single layer**:

![copy group to layer.gif](/images/copy_group_to_layer.gif)

You can find the merge operator (and others) in the drop down menu accesed by this button in the top bar:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%201.png)

{{< box_green "💡" >}}
**Tip**: You can decide what operators to show in the layer/group and top bar with [***“favourite operators”*** in preferences](#favourite-operators)
{{< /box_green >}}


The addon comes with an **improved way to merge layers** when their opacity is lower than 1.0*

{{< box_info >}}

<strong>*</strong>Blender don’t merge correctly the layers when they have transparency.


![With Blender’s normal merge behaviour (the transparency changes)](images/mergebad.webp)

💪With the **improved** way to merge:

![The result more faithful to the original state (without merging layers).](images/mergegoodV2.webp)

The result more **faithful** to the original state (without merging layers).
{{< /box_info >}}





To activate this mode, press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + RightClick" >}} when executing the operator.

This will manually sets the (being slower to merge, but offering better results)

### Customize Colors 🎨

You can **edit the layer/groups colors** by clicking their icon next to the name at the top of the list:

![colors.gif](/images/colors.gif)

{{< box_green "💡" >}}

**Tip**: When changing the color of a group, you can:
- hold {{< shortcut "SHIFT" >}} to **change** the color of **all child groups** 📂
- hold {{< shortcut "CTRL" >}} to **change** the color of **all layers** ✏
- hold {{< shortcut "ALT" >}} to **change all children's colors** ✏&📂

{{< /box_green >}}

### Open/close groups 📂

Click the folder icon to open/close a group. 

![better close.gif](/images/better_close.gif)

You can hold {{< shortcut "ALT" >}} while clicking to **open/collapse all children**.

You can open/collapse all groups in the list by pressing a folder icon while holding {{< shortcut "ALT + CONTROL" >}}.


{{< box_green "💡" >}}

**Tip**: You can press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + Left Click" >}} **in the group icon** to **add the element at the bottom** directly **to the group**.

Press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + ALT + Left Click" >}} to ungroup the last element in the group.

![Press `SHIFT + Left Click` to add the element below to a group](images/add_to_group.gif)

Press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + Left Click" >}} to **add the element below to a group**.

![Press `SHIFT + ALT + Left Click` to ungroup the last element in the group](images/ungroup.gif)

Press {{< shortcut "SHIFT + ALT + Left Click" >}} to **ungroup the last element in the group**.

{{< /box_green >}}


### Solo Modes 🔍

Blender’s solo mode {{< text_wavy "has been" 0.1 4 >}} {{< text_wavy "improved*❗" 0.06 10 >}}


> Originally, **after exiting the solo mode all layers became visible** (no matter if they were originally hidden), **loosing the previous visibility states**.

With this addon, **you don’t loose any change on your drawing since it saves its previous state**.

You can solo the layers/groups visibility 👁️ and lock 🔐 state.

{{< box_green >}}
The lock solo mode is specially *-super-* useful (❗) when sculpting, editing the strokes, weight painting, moving frames in the dopesheet, etc. (I use it a lot!)
{{< /box_green >}}


You can find them in the menu (next to the move arrows). Or you can add a shortcut to it ([see Favourite Operators in Preferences](#favourite-operators)).

Both solo modes <u>offers different **filter levels**</u>:

1. **Selected** - Only the selected element will be visible. If the selected element is a group, all its descendants will be visible.
2. **Siblings** - Only the selected element and its siblings will be visible.
3. **Top folder** - All elements in the root folder (in case of existing) will be visible.

![solo ez 3mb.gif](/images/solo_ez_3mb.gif)

It offers 2 possibilities for the visibility **solo mode**: 
- Hide layers
- Opacity fade

[Read about them here](#settings-).

### Inherited alpha 🖌

**Click** the **alpha button** next to the layer/groups properties to activate it.

{{< box_info >}}
When Inherited alpha is enabled, the layer/group content will only be visible in their sibling’s opacity.

![inherit alpha 1.gif](images/inherit_alpha_1.gif)

In this example, the base color and the shadow were drawn without considering whether they went outside the contour of the ball or not. When activating the alpha, its content is clipped by their siblings’ opactity, fitting perfectly into the ball’s silhouette.
{{< /box_info >}}



This was a feature that prettends to imitate [**Krita**’s inherited alpha](https://docs.krita.org/en/tutorials/clipping_masks_and_alpha_inheritance.html).

## Preferences 🛠

### Settings ⚙

- `Use lighs by default` - If True, (unparented*) **new layers** and groups **will use lights when they are created**. 
{{< box_warning >}}
*If they are created inside a group, they will **inherit** the group’s current properties.
{{< /box_warning >}}

- `Keep Vertex colors when changing brushes` - By default, each brush has its own main and secondary colour, so you lost the colour you had selected when changing to a new brush. Useful when you want to use another brush for its texture but you want to continue painting with the colour you had selected.

- `Solo visibility mode` - Select the method used when soloing the layers’ visibility. 
    - Offers 2 options:
        1. **Hide layers**: only the layers filtered will be visible, while the others will be completely hidden.
            
            ![solo hide.gif](/images/solo_hide.gif)
        <br>
        2. **Opactiy fade**: the layers filtered will be visible with its original opacity, while the rest will be faded by the selected opacity percentage in prefferences.
            
            ![solo opacity skull.gif](/images/solo_opacity_skull.gif)

        <br>

- `Duplicate Prefixes/Suffixes` - Set the prefixes (left) and suffixes (right) added when duplicating a group and a layer.
- `Automatic check for new versions` - If True (recommended), the addon will automatically check if there is a newer version uploaded.
    
{{< box_info >}}
This check happens only once when loading Blender
{{< /box_info >}}
    

#### Appearance 👁️

- `Visibility icons on the left side` - If True, the hide/show icon will be placed on the left (like in other graphic softwares like *Krita* or *Photoshop*).

![=anim_webp_11-10-2023_14-03-50,28.webp](/images/anim_webp_11-10-2023_14-03-5028.webp)

- `Show properties in list` - Decide if showing of not extra info in the list.
    1. **Use lights** - Indicates if the layer/group is affected by lights
    2. **Blend Mode** - Shows an icon with the blend mode used when is different than ‘Regular’
    3. **Opacity** - Shows the opacity directly in the list when it is different than 100%.
        
        ![Untitled](/images/Untitled%202.png)
        
    
    1. **Parent** - Show a bone icon when the layer/group is parented to another object.
    
    ![=anim_webp_12-10-2023_11-26-14,64.webp](/images/anim_webp_12-10-2023_11-26-1464.webp)

## FAQ❔
<!-- 
- ***Why do you write a FAQ section if no one has asked you a single question related the add-on?***
    
    Thats a very good question. I don’t know. I guess that if I ever got asked about something “frequently” (more than 0 times), I’ll clarify it here in case it’s useful for others 🐢. -->

<!-- 
### About Grease Pencil 3.0
{{< details "About updating to Blender's Grease Pencil 3.0 (Blender 4.3 and above)" true >}}
#### Current State
The addon works perfectly with Blender's version prior to Grease Pencil 3.0 (4.2 and below).

I would like to update to Blender's new Grease Pencil 3.0 (GP3.0), but I want to be honest about it, since I'm hesitating:

Since GP3.0 (**Blender 4.3 and above**), Blender already supports groups natively. 
My addon included lots of other features, but this was the main one, the group's support.

I added them in some *"hacky way"*, writing my own system. But now GP3.0 integrates them and this makes my addon:
- **A)** Not as useful/important as it used to be.
    - I worked a lot (really, a lot...) in this addon, and that is kinda sad/demotivating, to be honest.
- **B)** Specially harder to port into the new's GP folders and layers system, since in some way, by adapting to it I lose the control I had in my own system.
    - This makes it specially hard to implement some cool features my addon originally had, like the inherited alpha, and others.

An alternative to B) would be to *""""directly port \*""""* to GP3.0 and ignore new's folders and layers and still using my system. But this is not the most elegant and logical solution, specially thinking about the future.




{{< details "*Also, there is no way to easily \"directly port\" the changes" >}}
I already ported some more simpler addon to Grease Pencil 3.0 ([Grease Pencil Particles](https://orb91.gumroad.com/l/grease-pencil-particles?layout=profile)) to GP3.0, and the changes were HUGE, it took me more than I planned. And this (the GP Groups++ addon) is way more bigger and complex).
{{< /details >}}

Another discouraging thing is that Blender introduced natively some features my addon added (to be honest, makes me wonder if it was a coincidence, or they were aware about my addon and it inspired them those changes).

Due to all of this, and specially A), makes me hesitate if I should do the port or not, and just accept that the project doesn't have anymore the sense/importance it had.



#### About the future

To be honest, when I work with GP3.0 I miss (a lot!) some of the features. Like the customization, some operators to work with the groups/layers, the inherited alpha, etc.

**The most logical alternative would be to rebuild everything from zero**, and to try to figure out to add all the functionalities that are missing into GP3.0. I already started working on it, but I can't guaranteed is possible (like I said in B), nor the date.



{{< /details >}} -->

### About Supporting Grease Pencil 3.0
{{< details "About Updating to Blender’s Grease Pencil 3.0 (Blender 4.3 and Above)" true >}}
#### Current State

The addon works correctly with Blender versions prior to Grease Pencil 3.0 (Blender 4.2 and below).

With the introduction of GP3.0 (Blender 4.3 and above), Blender now includes native support for groups—one of the main features originally provided by this addon.

While the addon also includes several additional tools and workflows, this native implementation significantly reduces its original purpose and importance in newer versions of Blender.

Additionally, the addon implemented groups through its own custom system. Because GP3.0 introduces a new folders and layers structure, adapting the addon directly is technically complex and may limit or break some of its original features, such as inherited alpha and certain customization tools.

One theoretical alternative would be to port the addon while ignoring the new GP3.0 structure and continuing to use the original system. However, this would not be an elegant or future-proof solution, and in practice there is no straightforward way to do a direct port.

For these reasons, I am currently evaluating if a port still makes sense.

Meanwhile, the addon stills a very useful tool if you are working on Blender's versions prior to GP3.0.

#### About the Future

While working with GP3.0, I still strongly miss several capabilities originally provided by this addon (like the customization, some group/layer operators, the inherited alpha, and other workflow improvements).

The most reasonable long-term approach would be to rebuild the functionality from scratch, adapting it properly to GP3.0’s architecture. I have already started exploring this possibility, but at the moment I cannot guarantee that all features will be technically achievable, nor provide a timeline.

{{< /details >}}


- ***Why did you put icons on the header?***
    
    I personally like when I can distinguish clearly when some functionality comes from an addon I have installed and is not something native from Blender. Also, since I decided not to override the original Layer panel (in case someone would like to continue using it while having this addon installed), I wanted to make the panel to stand out from the other one. 
    
    - Also, I like to show my dog, Dex:
