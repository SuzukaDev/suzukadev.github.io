<!-- > Is an addon for saving time, basically. Personally I like experimenting and sometimes adding elastic bones to see if the object I'm animating could benefit from an elastic kind of motion.
>
> Creating (and later removing, leaving the rig correctly) elastic bones manually is a tedious process, specially if you are doing it for more than one bone.
>
> This addon makes that process **instantaneous**. -->

# How to use it ‚öô

1. Having an armature selected in **Edit** or **Pose Mode**, **select the bones** you want to make elastic.

{{< box_info >}}
The selected bone(s) have to be '*valid*'. This means that they should be in between two **connected** bones.

<!-- "Starting" and "ending" bones are not valid for making them elastic (the button is deactivated): -->
You cannot make the starting and ending bones elastic (notice that the button is deactivated):

<!-- For a bone to be able to stretch, it needs a head and a tail bone to determine from where and to where it stretches to. -->
For a bone to be able to stretch, it needs both a head and a tail bone to define the points from which it stretches and to which it stretches.

# FAQ ‚ùî

- ***Why do you write a FAQ section if no one has asked you a single question related the add-on?***
  
    Thats a very good question. I don‚Äôt know. I guess that if I ever got asked about something ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù (more than 2 times), I‚Äôll clarify it here in case it‚Äôs useful for others üê¢.
